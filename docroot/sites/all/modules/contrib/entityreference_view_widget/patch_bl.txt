Reason "Support Search API Solr view"
Applied patch from https://www.drupal.org/node/2462247
patch https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/entityreference_view_widget-support_search_api_solr-2462247-1.patch

Original patch didn't work, so I did two small changes

FROM: $entity_id = $row->_entity_properties[$this->view->base_field];
TO: $entity_id = $row->entity;

FROM: $entity_id = $values->_entity_properties[$this->view->base_field];
TO: $entity_id = $values->entity;
